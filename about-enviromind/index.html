                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We live in a globalized world, where climate change is a global issue. Climate responsibility though, is often distributed on a national level, where all countries should meet the same climate goals, regardless of their prerequisites. </p></br>

                <p>But countries, just as people, have their own unique history and stories to tell. More importantly, they depend on - and are affected by - each other. By treating countries and their emissions as isolated entities these insights can easily fall through the cracks.</p></br>
 
                <p>Enviromind tries to challenge this by visualising the relationship between countries environmental and economic data. This, we hope, will reveal international relationships and provide historical and economical context to the climate debate.</p>

                  <h2>Process</h2>
                  <p>This project was created by 8 master students at the Royal Institute of Technology as part of the course Information Visualization. The time frame for the project was 4 weeks with a part-time speed. 
                Our aim was to display environmental and economic data and let the user explore the connections and relationships between them, both on a national and global level. We also wanted to give the user the space and freedom to explore and interpret the data without steering them in a certain direction.
                <br/><br/>
                We also decided to work in an iterative and user centered process to stay time effective. Through a lot of prototyping we were able to evaluate at several stages what should be in the final design and not and this helped us to not spend time on unnecessary tasks.
                <br/><br/>
                In order to get going with the project we started off by setting up tasks for each person so that we all would get our hands dirty as soon as possible and be able to set things up simultaneously. These tasks involved searching for data, defining the concept, setting up a code structure, creating a time plan for the project and starting to sketch on the first design ideas. We then formed one prototyping team and one team of developers. The prototyping team focused on creating prototypes in several stages and the developing process followed that of the prototyping. We also made sure to keep a good communication throughout the whole process, updating each other about the progress.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Technologies and tools used:</strong> Trello, Slack, Discord, Google Drive, Github, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, D3.js, analog sketches, Atomic and Photoshop. The data was collected from The World Bank and imported through CSV-files. 
                <br/><br/>
                We have gained greater insights into the difficulties and the benefits of information visualization from this project. Visualizing data from the whole world has been challenging and colors and different sizing has helped us achieve what we think is a good representation of the huge dataset.</p>

                            <p>I started this project in the prototyping team and then transferred to the developing team. I worked with making sure our visualization met the aimed user experience goals, by making the barchart appear as wished and setting up the final design created by the prototype team. I also did the line charts for the comparison view and helped plan and structure the work. Together with Frida I designed and created this website.</p>

                            <p>Mainly, I have been involved in concept development and design. In concept development I have contributed through merging and establishing the relationship between the different variables featured in Enviromind. When it comes to design i have been involved in the overall layout, visualization and interaction. 
                            Besides from concept and design I was in charge of data collection and was in involved in testing and composed the music in the presentation video.
