# ENVIROMIND

We live in a globalized world, where climate change is a global issue. Climate responsibility though, is often distributed on a national level, where all countries should meet the same climate goals, regardless of their prerequisites. 

But countries, just as people, have their own unique history and stories to tell. More importantly, they depend on - and are affected by - each other. By treating countries and their emissions as isolated entities these insights can easily fall through the cracks.
 
Enviromind tries to challenge this by visualising the relationship between countries environmental and economic data. This, we hope, will reveal international relationships and provide historical and economical context to the climate debate.

## What is Enviromind?

Enviromind is a visualization tool that uses enviromental and economical data from [The World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) and visualizes it over time both on a national and global level. 

The project was created by 8 master students at the Royal Insitute of Technology in the course Information Visualization.
